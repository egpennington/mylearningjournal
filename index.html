                <h1>Rebooting at 55: My Coding Journey</h1>
                <p>At 55, I decided it was time to learn something new: coding. Front-end programming sounded intriguing, so I dove into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My first challenge was setting up my development environment. It felt like learning a new language...</p>

                <p>Learning CSS wasn’t easy, but one day, I came across Flexbox. It was confusing at first, trying to understand all the properties. But after a few days of tinkering, I managed to create a responsive layout for...</p>

                <h2>JavaScript Arrays, My First Struggle</h2>
                <p>JavaScript seemed like a beast compared to HTML and CSS, especially when I encountered arrays. I remember the frustration of trying to loop through an array and manipulate data. After hours of trial and error, I finally got...</p>

                <p>Forms in HTML seemed simple at first—just a few fields, right? But making the form validate user input using JavaScript was another story. I struggled with it for days. When I finally...</p>

                <p>Building a site that looks good on both desktop and mobile devices was a huge milestone. Media queries in CSS were a challenge, but I spent time tweaking breakpoints and...</p>
