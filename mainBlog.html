            <h2>Rebooting at 55: My Coding Journey</h2>
            <p>At 55, I decided it was time to learn something new: coding. Front-end programming sounded intriguing, so I dove into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My first challenge was setting up my development environment. It felt like learning a new language, but when I saw my first "Hello, World!" displayed on a webpage, I was thrilled! It was a small step, but it sparked a fire in me to keep going. Learning to code has been about perseverance and embracing a beginner's mindset.</p>

            <h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>
            <p>Staying committed to learning code at 55 hasn’t always been easy, but I've found ways to keep myself motivated. I set small, achievable goals and celebrate each win, no matter how minor it seems. When I hit roadblocks, I remind myself why I started: to embrace a new challenge and build something meaningful. Listening to podcasts like <strong>How I Built This</strong> with Guy Raz has been a great source of inspiration, as I hear stories of entrepreneurs who overcame struggles to achieve success. Their journeys remind me that persistence is key and that everyone starts somewhere.</p>
            <p>Another source of motivation has been the <strong>Scrimba podcast</strong> with Alex Booker, which gives practical tips and insights from developers who’ve been through the same struggles. Hearing other coders share their experiences and advice reassures me that it's okay to face setbacks. I often listen to these podcasts while walking or during breaks, using them as a way to stay engaged with the coding community and learn even when I’m not at the computer. These habits keep my commitment strong, turning learning to code into a daily practice rather than a daunting task.</p>
            <h3>How I got started</h3>
            <p>I got started with coding when I realized I wanted to learn something completely new and challenging. The idea of building something from scratch, just by typing commands, fascinated me. I began with basic HTML and CSS tutorials, learning how to structure a webpage and style it. The first time I saw something I created come to life on the screen, it was exhilarating. Seeing my thoughts turn into a functional and visual reality was awesome. It felt like a superpower, and I knew I wanted to experience that feeling again and again.</p>
            <p>Coding quickly became more than just a hobby—it was like a drug, a high that I couldn’t get enough of. The hours would fly by as I dove into projects, trying to make each one better than the last. When I’m coding, I get into the zone where nothing else matters; it’s just me and the code, solving problems and creating. It’s that feeling of flow that keeps me going, even when I hit bumps along the way. It’s not just about learning a new skill; it’s about experiencing the joy of making ideas come alive.</p>

                <h2>My First Layout with Flexbox</h2>
                <p>Learning CSS wasn’t easy, but one day, I came across Flexbox. It was confusing at first, trying to understand all the properties. But after a few days of tinkering, I managed to create a responsive layout for the first time! Seeing my design adjust to different screen sizes felt like magic. It was a major win that boosted my confidence. The moment made me realize that I could solve any problem if I kept at it.</p>

                <h2>JavaScript Arrays, My First Struggle</h2>
                <p>JavaScript seemed like a beast compared to HTML and CSS, especially when I encountered arrays. I remember the frustration of trying to loop through an array and manipulate data. After hours of trial and error, I finally got it to work. It felt like solving a puzzle, and that “aha” moment was incredibly rewarding. It taught me to appreciate the process and reminded me that every failure is a step closer to success.</p>

                <h2>The Day I Made My First Form Work</h2>
                <p>Forms in HTML seemed simple at first—just a few fields, right? But making the form validate user input using JavaScript was another story. I struggled with it for days. When I finally managed to get all the validation checks working, I felt like a true programmer. That experience showed me that every small win counts, especially when you're just starting.</p>
