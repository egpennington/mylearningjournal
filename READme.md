## Features

1. **Responsive Design**:
   - The layout adapts to different screen sizes using media queries.
   - Implemented a mobile-first approach for better performance on smaller devices.

2. **Relative Units**:
   - Used relative units like percentages, ems, and rems for better scalability and responsiveness.

3. **Viewport Meta Tags**:
   - Added viewport meta tags to ensure proper scaling and rendering on different devices.

4. **Canva Design Studio**:
    - Utilized Canva to resize two of the images.  Worked well.
    - Used Canva also to flip the header image so light would be on the right hand side.
